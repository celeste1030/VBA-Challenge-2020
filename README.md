VBA Challenge

## About
This is a coding practice assignment completed during my data science training.

## Instructions

### Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

  * You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

## Bonus Challenges

1. Your solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". 

2. Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.

## Results

* To submit please upload the following to Github:

  * A screen shot for each year of your results on the Multi Year Stock Data.

  * VBA Scripts as separate files.

* Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits), a thorough README.md file

* After everything has been saved, create a sharable link and submit that to <https://bootcampspot-v2.com/>.
